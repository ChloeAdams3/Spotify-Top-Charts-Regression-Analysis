# Project Title
Spotify Top Charts Multivariable Regression Analysis

# Description 
This project attempts to determine the factors that affect a song’s length of time on Spotify top charts. My team and I developed a multi-variable regression model to estimate the weeks a song will be on Spotify’s Top Charts using a Kaggle Dataset. 

# Data Used
